fps paintball game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintball

slightly futuristic/fantasy style
indoor paintball only to simplify level design
has rpg elements (upgrading and buying new weapons)
-> about 4-5 weapons and customizeable characters

Ball hit results in Texture paint maybe. Texture get's painted with a splat of the players color. (Check panda3d texturing and texture painting)
-> Take a look at tagger from drwr which should have good samples and even the functionality we like to have.

use simple fps styled controll, maybe include bullet enhanced char controller as used in rising or stay completely with p3d's own collision and physics system.
